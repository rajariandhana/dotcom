My game is about a lighthouse (meaning mercusuar in Indonesia) that must shine it's light towards incoming ship preventing them from crashing into the island. The game submitted for the competition has a lot of bugs and implemented features since the it happens at the same time with GMTK's Game Jam meaning I only have 15 hours working on this game. After the jam ended I fixed the bugs and implement more features such as tutorial screen, audio, even more obstacles like sharks and tornadoes.",
