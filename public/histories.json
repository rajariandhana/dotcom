The best part of course a \"Rick Roll\" disguised as a way to get free money (this is a reminder to be careful on the internet)."

Laravel gives easy access to CRUD features and become my goto tech stack combined with Tailwindcss, Alpine.js, and Livewire. Every single data is inserted in the database, but the weird thing is all data are inserted from laravel's seed feature so I actually did not create a form for me to upload those data so... Either way I finally showcased my projects using a \"Bento Box\", mimnicking Apple. Also I finally bought my own domain."
